    <h2>What is space and time complexity</h2>
    <p><strong>Time Complexity -</strong> The amount of time required for an alogorithm to run, as a function of input size</p>
    <p><strong>Space Complexity -</strong> The amount of memory required for an alogorithm to run, as a function of input size</p>

    <h2>How to represent time and space complexity</h2>
    <p>It is done by using Asymptotic notations</p>
    these are mathematical tools to represent this

    <p>1. Big-O-Notation - Worst Case Complexity</p>
    <p>2. Omega-Notation - Best Case Complexity</p>
    <p>3. Theta-Notation - Average Case Complexity</p>
